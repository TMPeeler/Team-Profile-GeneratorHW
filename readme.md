## Team Profile Generator HW

The purpose of this assignment is to dynamically generate an HTML page using object constructors and command line prompts with use of node and the inquirer NPM package.

## Getting Started

I started a fresh repo and started generating all my files, then I wrote base functions for what I wanted to do and having them interact with each other based on return values from a user input.

### Prerequisites

In order to accomplish the goal of this assignment, I had to use VSCode for the HTML and CSS as well as the Bulma framework for styling. I used github and gitbash to communicate my repo from my local machine to the server side repo. I also needed to have node, inquirer, and the node fs package.

### Solving

The solve of this assignment was done through prompting the user through the command line and then using template literals to fill in html with functions depending on user input and object construction. The user is asked to answer prompts which fill up cards with values and those cards are then written to a new HTMl file.
